<p>5. Hosting Status, Moderation and Legal Obligations</p>
<p>5.1 Hosting Status</p>
<p>In accordance with the LCEN law (article 6-I-2), Signyalé acts as a hosting provider.  
This means we do not pre-edit content.  
But if unlawful content is clearly reported, we remove it promptly.</p>

<p>5.2 Reporting Tool and Right of Reply</p>
<p>A tool accessible to everyone, even without an account, allows reporting of any content:<br>
• unlawful,<br>
• defamatory,<br>
• discriminatory,<br>
• or contrary to public order.<br>
Any person mentioned may request a right of reply, which will be published within 3 days.</p>

<p>5.3 False Reports and Abuse</p>
<p>Wrongfully reporting lawful content with the aim of having it removed is an offense:  
punishable by 1 year in prison and a €15,000 fine (article 6-VII LCEN).</p>

<p>6. Intellectual Property</p>
<p>6.1 What you publish belongs to you.<br>
When you publish content (text, photo, price, etc.), you remain the owner. But you authorize Signyalé to use it free of charge in the application to display it, disseminate it or promote it in the community.</p>
<p>6.2 What belongs to Signyalé:<br>
The name “Signyalé”, the strawberry logo, colors, drawings, app texts, design, code, and all functionalities are protected by law (copyright and registered trademark).</p>
<p>6.3 What you may not do:<br>
• Copy the name “Signyalé” or our logo for your own communication without written consent.<br>
• Modify or reuse our visuals, graphics or content elsewhere.<br>
• Present yourself as a partner or official representative without authorization.<br>
You may say that you are on Signyalé (e.g.: “Our products are visible on Signyalé”), but without altering our logo or misleading others.<br>
In case of unauthorized use, Signyalé may request the removal of content and take necessary steps to enforce its rights.</p>

<p>7. Personal Data and Privacy Policy</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy (available in the app) explains:<br>
• One-off use of geolocation only<br>
• No permanent tracking<br>
• Hosting of data in France<br>
• Your rights (access, deletion, rectification, objection, portability)</p>
<p>Service providers used:<br>
• PayPal / Stripe: merchant payments<br>
• Brevo (Sendinblue): emails and alerts<br>
• Firebase (Google): technical storage and analysis<br>
All these providers comply with GDPR, with contractual safeguards (SCC / DPF).  
Explicit consent is requested when required by law.</p>

<p>8. “Right to One’s Image” and Privacy</p>
<p>At Signyalé, we want everyone to feel respected. Rules to follow when publishing a photo in the app:</p>
<p><strong>No identifiable faces without permission</strong><br>
You must never publish a photo clearly showing a person (face, recognizable silhouette, identifiable posture…) without their consent.  
This is the law (Civil Code, Article 9). Publishing such an image without authorization is an infringement of image rights. If it happens, the person concerned may claim damages.</p>
<p><strong>Do not show people’s private life</strong><br>
Even if no person is visible, do not photograph a private place, a storefront with a family name, an identifiable business, etc. Respect everyone’s privacy.</p>
<p>Geolocation is only used at the time of reporting, never in the background.  
You can disable it at any time in the app settings.</p>
<p><strong>Personal data: what it means</strong><br>
If a photo or information can identify a person, directly or indirectly (example: a store or a regular seller), then it becomes personal data. In this case, we inform you:<br>
• why we collect the data (e.g.: to report a price, build an interactive map),<br>
• how long it is kept (max. 12 months),<br>
• your rights (view, modify, delete, object…),<br>
• how to contact the CNIL if needed.<br>
All this is detailed in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>If you are concerned by a published image</strong><br>
If your image or privacy is exposed on Signyalé without your consent:<br>
• Send us an email at contact@signyale.com,<br>
• Or use the “Report this content” button (accessible even without an account).</p>
<p><strong>Your responsibility</strong><br>
Everyone is responsible for the content they publish.  
Signyalé is not responsible if you post a photo or comment that harms someone. But if a problem is reported to us, we act quickly (as provided by LCEN – article 6-I-2).</p>

<p>9. Accessibility and Inclusion</p>
<p>Signyalé provides several formats to aid understanding:<br>
• visual versions,<br>
• printable documents.</p>

<p>10. Limitation of Liability</p>
<p>Each user is responsible for the information they publish.  
If content is defamatory or illegal, responsibility lies with the author.</p>
<p>For security reasons, technical logs are collected: IP, date, device.  
These data are:<br>
• kept for 7 days maximum,<br>
• pseudonymized,<br>
• accessible only to authorized administrators.<br>
The Portainer tool used ensures security and confidentiality.</p>

<p>11. Changes to the Terms</p>
<p>The Terms may evolve according to service needs or the law.  
In case of significant modification, you will be informed via the app.</p>

<p>12. Governing Law</p>
<p>These Terms are governed by French law. Any dispute will be submitted to the competent courts of Paris.</p>

<p><strong>COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST – SIGNYALÉ TERMS</strong></p>
<p>To concretely implement Signyalé’s Terms of Use in the mobile app — here is an operational plan structured by item, with technical, UX/UI and educational actions to integrate during development or in subsequent iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong><br>
• Clear language interface, with pictograms + short texts (e.g.: “Add a price”, “Validate”, “Sent!”).<br>
• One-off geolocation, without active tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong><br>
• Request geolocation only at the time of reporting, via an explicit pop-up.<br>
• No background access to GPS position.<br>
• Clear mention in user settings: “The app does not track you”.<br>
• Ability to create a merchant account without requiring a SIRET (checkbox “de facto trade” / “occasional seller”).<br>
• Flexible profile forms: no obligation for legal status / proof of registration.<br>
• Publication system without predefined stock, to match unplanned arrivals.</p>
