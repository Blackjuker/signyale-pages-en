        The Terms of Use of the Signyalé application have been drafted taking into account the sociological specificities of the target audience in metropolitan France.<br>
        They reflect:<br>
        <strong>Simple and accessible language</strong>, adapted to a young and mobile audience.<br>
        <strong>Respect for privacy</strong>: geolocation is used only occasionally, without active tracking, and data remains limited to local use.<br>
        <strong>Consumption habits</strong>: cash payments, direct trust, promotion of short supply chains, without imposed business models.<br>
        <strong>Digital inclusion</strong>: educational materials (factsheets, audio) are provided for less connected audiences.<br>
        <strong>Recognition of informal practices</strong>: no administrative or commercial constraints are imposed on local users.<br>
        This approach guarantees understandable information, data protection in compliance with the GDPR, and an experience faithful to the social realities of potential users.

  <p>5.1 Hosting status</p>
  <p>In accordance with the French Digital Economy Law (LCEN, Article 6-I-2), Signyalé acts as a <strong>hosting provider</strong>.<br>
  This means we <strong>do not pre-edit content</strong>.<br>
  However, if clearly unlawful content is reported, we remove it promptly.</p>

    <li>Defamatory.</li>
    <li>Discriminatory.</li>
    <li>Contrary to public order.</li>

  <p>Any person named may request a <strong>right of reply</strong>, which will be published within 3 days.</p>

  <p>5.3 False reports and abuse</p>
  <p>Falsely reporting lawful content to have it removed is a <strong>criminal offense</strong>: 1 year in prison and a €15,000 fine (Article 6-VII LCEN).</p>

  <p>6. Intellectual property</p>

  <p>6.1 What you publish belongs to you.</p>
  <p>When you publish content (text, photo, price…), you remain the owner. But you authorize Signyalé to use it for free in the application to display, distribute, or promote it in the community.</p>

  <p>6.2 What belongs to Signyalé:</p>
  <p>The name “Signyalé”, the strawberry logo, colors, drawings, application texts, design, code, and all features are protected by law (copyright and registered trademark).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Copy the name “Signyalé” or our logo for your own communication without written consent.</li>
    <li>Modify or reuse our visuals, graphics, or content elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Present yourself as a partner or official representative without authorization.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In case of unauthorized use, Signyalé may request removal and take necessary steps to enforce its rights.</p>

  <p>7. Personal data and privacy policy</p>

    <li><strong>No permanent tracking</strong></li>
    <li>Data hosting in <strong>France</strong></li>
    <li>Your rights (access, deletion, rectification, objection, portability)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Service providers used:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>PayPal / Stripe</strong>: merchant payments</li>

  Explicit consent is requested when required by law.</p>

  <p>8. Image rights and respect for privacy</p>

  <p>At Signyalé, we want everyone to feel respected. The rules when publishing a photo are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No identifiable faces without authorization.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You must not publish a photo showing a person’s face, recognizable silhouette, or identifiable posture without their consent (Civil Code, Article 9).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No invasion of private life.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Do not photograph private places, shopfronts with surnames, or identifiable businesses without permission.</p>

  <p>Geolocation is only used at the moment of reporting, never in the background.<br>
  You can disable it anytime in the app settings.</p>

  <p>If a photo or information can identify a person, directly or indirectly (e.g., a shop or a regular seller), it becomes personal data.</p>

  <p>We then inform you about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The purpose of data collection (e.g., reporting a price, creating a map).</li>
    <li>How long it is kept (12 months max).</li>
    <li>Your rights (view, edit, delete, oppose, etc.).</li>
    <li>How to contact the CNIL if needed.</li>

  <p><strong>Your responsibility:</strong></p>
  <p>Everyone is responsible for the content they publish.<br>
  Signyalé is not liable if you post content infringing on others’ rights. But if an issue is reported, we act promptly (as required by LCEN – Article 6-I-2).</p>

  <p>9. Accessibility and inclusion</p>
  <p>Signyalé offers several formats to make information easier to understand:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Visual versions</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Printable documents</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>10. Limitation of liability</p>
  <p>Each user is <strong>responsible</strong> for the information they publish.<br>
  If content is defamatory or illegal, responsibility lies with its author.</p>

  <p>For security reasons, <strong>technical logs</strong> are collected: IP, date, device.<br>
  These data are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kept for 7 days max.</li>
    <li>Pseudonymized.</li>
    <li>Accessible only to authorized administrators.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Portainer tool used ensures <strong>security and confidentiality</strong>.</p>

  In case of significant changes, you will be <strong>notified via the application</strong>.</p>
